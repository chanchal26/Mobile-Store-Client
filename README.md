## What Are a Mobile Store Responsibilities?


Under a state's bar admission, lawyers must uphold the law and protect the rights of their clients. In addition to actually knowing the law, particularly within their practice area, an attorney must communicate clearly with their clients, work competently to resolve their clients' needs, and be ethical in performing their duties.



## What Are the Requirements for Becoming a Mobile Store?


People who hope to become lawyers must first complete special training and meet other professional requirements. Although each state has its own standards for licensing attorneys, most states require hopeful lawyers to obtain an undergraduate degree and then graduate from an accredited law school. Once the formal education is complete, they must also take and pass the state's bar examination (a rigid test of knowledge in all fields of law), submit to an investigation into their moral character and fitness to practice law, and be sworn in by their state's supreme court.



## May Mobile Store Who Is Licensed in One State Practice Law in Another State?


No. Lawyers must comply with a state's bar admission requirements to practice law in that state. However, some states allow out-of-state attorneys to practice law if they have a certain amount of legal experience and receive approval from the state's highest court. Sometimes attorneys may participate in specific cases in states where they lack a license to do so, referred to as a "pro hac vice" (or "for this one particular occasion") appearance.



### How Much Do Mobile Store Cost?


It depends. Attorneys typically charge by the hour, based on their level of experience and other factors, but sometimes they charge a flat fee for certain transactions. While a one- or two-hour visit might cost a few hundred dollars (sometimes the first consultation is free), an ongoing legal dispute or issue can cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. On the other hand, some personal injury attorneys don't collect a dime unless you win your case.
